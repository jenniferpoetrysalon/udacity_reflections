FC (WIN file compare) and diff (LINUX & Mac difference)

FC/diff  compares line by line
FC/diff  identifies changes per line
FC/diff  highlights & compares section by section
//of each file

HISTORY for EFFICACY

//version control history
//allows reflection over time
//time saved
//learn from past mistakes
//return to a previous version
	if an attempt goes awry
//never fear it's all here!

Git commit, manual saving vs. auto-save

PRO git commit
//you choose
//one commit per logical change
//control
//deliberate

CON git commit
//can't forget to commit
//could over or under commit
//aka could be a hollywood or pgh LOL (Celebrity Faire ref)


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

//Some version contronls, 
	lit Git, allow saving multiple files
	because their users and the purpose
	of the version control system
	is for linked files.  The files
	for Git are often in bunches
	and are interdepent.

//While version control systems like Google Docs
	are for writers and files, though related,
	can be combined or seperated by the user
	and are not dependent upon each other to 'run'.
	Furthermore, a user of a Google Doc is thinking
	about the words stopping to save one logical change
	per commit would interfere with the process rather
	than enhance the user experience.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

//git diff helps to compare two documents.  
//Changes are easily viewed between two distinct versions that is between two commits.

//git log allows you to see a list of all the versions.
//Summaries of the changes, the commit ID, time stamp and made by are quickly visible.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

//Version control allows TIME TRAVEL!
//Break away because with git I can identify and locate bugs/broken code
//and reinstate or ressurrect or copy the original lines of code that worked.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
//I'd like to use Git for my future 
//Sundaysapp, SEC college live scoring app, and PoemMe app.
