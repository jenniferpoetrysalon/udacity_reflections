What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

//Initalizing a repository 
//creates the .git file.
//It creates a folder and pathway
//for git to store future commits.
//This enables git to allow me to
//commit and control versions thru
//git log, git diff, git clone, git checkout, etc.
//Aka I can see different commit versions.
//Remember:  a commit reflects one logical change.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

//The staging area is where we work on the file before
//executing a commit.
//The repository houses
//the files including
//the git file where the commits(versions)
//can be tracked.
